        <p id="p1">
          In this graphic, we have a simple illustration of a child's
          birthday party. We decided to use an animal theme for this invite.
          We printed the words fun and playfully, and the colour scheme looks
          bright and light-hearted. The name of the child and the year they
          will be turning is coloured in a darker tone and sized bigger,
          underlying the person being the reason for the event. A description
          of the location, day, date and time provides information on when
          and where the party will occur.  
        </p>
        <img id="img2" src="./Assets/Solutions_Pictures/Wedding Invite.jpg" style="height: 450px; width: auto;"/>
        <p id="p2">
          In this graphic, we illustrate a wedding event that will take
          place for Mr. Amir Singh and Ms. Samira Naidoo. Since this is
          a Hindu wedding, there are elements representing the tradition
          and culture, such as the Om symbol and Ganesha graphic. The
          colours used here are gold and darkened blue, which are
          traditional Hindu wedding colours. We have respectfully
          mentioned the names of the bride and groom's immediate family
          ancestry. We have displayed this event's day, date, time and
          venue. The formatting of the date and the style of the words
          make this specific illustration stand out. It gives the feeling
          of a majestic and immaculate wedding that will take place.
